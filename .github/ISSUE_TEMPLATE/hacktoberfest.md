🆕🐥☝ Beginners Only:
This issue is reserved for people who are new to Open Source. We know that the process of creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This issue is for you 💝

To do:
The README for this project has some repeat/placeholder comments. If you look at the look at the Readme you will see resources, articles, webpages, videos etc that have the same generic comment to describe them. Take a look at one of those resources and see if you can figure out a more descriptive comment to tell readers what they will get out of looking at it. Only choose one for now - to give others a chance.

Alternatively... perhaps you would like to add content to this list. Feel free to do that to, but make sure that what you suggest we add in as really useful. We don't want people to be overwhelmed with too many choices, or demotivated by content that is not accessible to beginners. Make suggestions for resources/people that you have used yourself and comes with your most heartfelt recommendation.

📋 Step by Step
There is a Step-By-Step Guide to bring you **From Issue to Pull Request** in the docs folder - called **Getting-Started.md**
